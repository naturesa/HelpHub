# HelpHub

HelpHub is a platform designed to connect volunteers with elders or disabled people that are isolated or alone and need a helping hand.

By creating a platform where both volunteers and people in need can register, it enables users to find each other based on their location and specific needs.

This project was developed during the Code for All bootcamp as our final project, with a tight 3-day deadline.

## Features
User Registration: Allows both people in need and volunteers to register on the platform.
User Profiles: Displays user details such as contact information and location.
Interactive Cards: Users can see a list of registered individuals (both volunteers and those in need) in a card view.
Search and Filter: You can search for volunteers based on specific service.
